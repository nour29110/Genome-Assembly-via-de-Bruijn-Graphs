# Implmenting an Genome Assembler: Phi-X174 genome using Overlap Graph, Kmer Composition and De-Bruijn Graph.

Phi X 174 (ΦX174) is a single-stranded DNA virus that holds the distinction of being the first DNA-based genome to be sequenced, a milestone achieved by Fred Sanger’s team in 1977. Prior to this, in 1962, Walter Fiers and Robert Sinsheimer had already confirmed that ΦX174’s DNA is a covalently closed circular molecule. Later, Nobel laureate Arthur Kornberg used ΦX174 as a model system to demonstrate that DNA synthesized in vitro by purified enzymes could recreate all the attributes of a natural virus—paving the way for synthetic biology. In 2003, Craig Venter’s group successfully assembled the entire ΦX174 genome in vitro from synthetic oligonucleotides, even achieving the complete in vitro assembly of the virus particle. More recent research has shown that its highly overlapping genome can be fully decompressed while retaining full functionality.
